# Play Multiple YouTube Videos
A React application that allows users to view YouTube videos, play audio/video files, and take notes. Why would anybody want to play multiple YouTube videos from the convenience of a single page? Well, I don't know about other people, but I occasionally want to include ambient noises and/or other noises for a personalized, immersive listening experience. Manually playing multiple audio/videos at a time is a hassle.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ArmSiwatK/play-multiple-videos.git

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
